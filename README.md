# Eye-Pointer
![](image.jpg?raw=true)

A system designed for amputees to assist them in using computers. The system provides different functionalities to the users: navigate computers using head movements, eye blink for clicking, different head gestures to read documents and watch multimedia. The system is developed using C#.<br/> 
• The head movement is tracked using EmguCV (OpenCV wrapper) and some heuristic calculations.<br/>
• The movement is smoothened using Kalman filtering. <br/>
• This system implements the Viola-Jones algorithm for detection (i.e., blink & face).<br/>
• This system also supports voice commands for different functionalities.<br/>
